<h1>Genetic Algorithms for Travelling Salesman Problem</h1>

<p>This project is an implementation of genetic algorithms for travelling salesman problem in MatlabR2017b environment.</p>

* Crossover algorithm: `Order Crossover (OX)`

* To select individuals from current generation: `Tournament selection`

<h2>Explanations</h2>
<p>Cities are given with `X` and `Y` coordinates in 2D.</p>
<p>Program asks for you to input population size after you run it.</p>
<p>Program is automatically using the given 80 cities for calculations, but it is also possible that running the algorithm for random cities. For that you need to uncomment 4th line in generateCities.m, and comment fixed arrays.</p>
<p>While program is running it displays in a plot the current best road has been found so far.</p>
<p>After program finished running it displays another graph which shows the best roads for each generation.</p>
